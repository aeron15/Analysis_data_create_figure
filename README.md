# Analysis_data_create_figure

Analysis of data to create figures for paper on phenotypic variation.

This version creates raw data figures with replicates. 

The main script is compute_setpoints_reference_BC187.m

The script driver_main_figures.m plots all the figures of the paper to the output path

The script Set_fig_RE.m was moved to this folder so that changes in the figures are global.
